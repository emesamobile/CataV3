       <p>As a unique wine tourism enclave, La Cata del Barrio de la Estación will be accompanied in its Gourmet journey by a gastronomic proposal at the height of the twelve great wines that attendees can enjoy, full of award-winning master chefs, many of them, with several Michelin Stars . All of them, in addition, stand out for the exquisite care and affection they dedicate to wine in their respective houses.</p>
